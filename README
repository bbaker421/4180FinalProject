#FACE LOCK

This project uses facial recognition to authenticate a user in order to open a door lock. If a user is authorized, the door lock opens, a green LED is lit, and a noise is played from a speaker. If a user is not authorized, the door lock will not open, a red LED is lit, and police siren noises are played from the speaker.
